# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 22, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started my Nightlife Tracker app (for [this FCC challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app)) in earnest.

**Thoughts**: My first Angular app. So far so good.

### Day 1: June 23, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I've got login working, Yelp search results loading, and clicks recording as RSVPs... Not yet pulling click counts, or allowing users to remove RSVPs, but I think I should be able to finish this tomorrow, with a bit of time. Will push my changes to github shortly.

**Thoughts:** It feels like one hour a day is a vast underestimation of what I'll be able to devote to this most days, at least until I find a job.

### Day 2: June 24, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Have RSVP result counts pulling properly and listing on user's page. Think I have removal done, but still haven't figured out how to get new clicks listed on profile.

**Thoughts:** A truly one page app like this makes things a bit complicated.

### Day 3: June 25, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Ended up re-organizing my app fairly significantly for better usability, and simpler coding. Almost done though!!

**Thoughts:** Just found this Angular Style Guide that I think will be really helpful ([on github](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide))

### Day 4: June 26, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Nightlife Tracker app. It's up at [https://nightlife-tracker.herokuapp.com](https://nightlife-tracker.herokuapp.com). Gonna update my portfolio to include it + my voting app and other back-end projects. I'm getting pretty close to done with the back-end certification.

**Thoughts**: I think that Angular finally started to click in my brain yesterday/today. So that's good. I still wish that FCC had anywhere near as good material coverage for back-end topics as they do for their front-end program (or that Odin had an up-to-date, thorough, JS course).

**2nd Thoughts**: Two things:
- I just did a great tutorial on Gulp from CSS-Tricks that I would recommend to everyone check it if you aren't already familiar with Gulp. I'd been avoiding it, and had been confused by my interactions with it, but building up a script from scratch really clarified everything for me. You can check out [that tutorial here](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).
- I've only had my Nightlife Track app up for about 12 hours, and already, people have searched on it 90+ times (and I swear only a couple of those were me). From all over, too (by the cities they searchedâ€”-all I'm logging is their search term.) That's pretty neat!

### Day 5: June 27, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Rather than starting in on a new project, I took time today to update my personal website and then dug in on JS unit testing for the first time. Added tests to my [timestamp microservice](https://github.com/ubershibs/timestamp).

**Thoughts**: I'm going to endeavour to add tests to everything I've built for the Back End track so far, and then try TDD for my next bigger project... Not committing to it, just to trying it.

### Day 6: June 28, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about unit testing. Specifically about writing tests for Mongoose models. Added some to my Voting App. Check them out [on Github](https://github.com/ubershibs/voting-app);

### Day 7: June 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I really focused on applying for jobs today, so all I had time to do were two quick exercises on CodeEval, and a couple tutorials for D3 to get myself geared up for the next back end project, the stock market app.

Link to work: you can check out my [CodeEval profile](https://www.codeeval.com/dashboard/), and the [github repo](https://github.com/ubershibs/codeeval) where I put all my solutions.
