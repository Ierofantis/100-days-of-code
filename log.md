# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 22, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started my Nightlife Tracker app (for [this FCC challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app)) in earnest.

**Thoughts**: My first Angular app. So far so good.

### Day 1: June 23, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I've got login working, Yelp search results loading, and clicks recording as RSVPs... Not yet pulling click counts, or allowing users to remove RSVPs, but I think I should be able to finish this tomorrow, with a bit of time.

**Thoughts:** It feels like one hour a day is a vast underestimation of what I'll be able to devote to this most days, at least until I find a job.
